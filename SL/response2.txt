When making codes:\r\n-Look at what's trending for ideas and then try to recode it\r\n-A Tic-tac-toe game will test your majority of knowledge you have of your language\r\n-Use other's codes but don't repost their code unedited as you own work. Give credit\r\n\r\n4. When doing challenges:\r\n-Have a pen, paper an calculator with you\r\n-Challenge high level players when you're low level and vice versa\r\n-Search up the correct answers for all the questions you get wrong after every challenge before challenging again\r\n\r\n5. When making quizzes:\r\n-Make quizzes while you're doing a course\r\n-Keep it about programming, no Pokemon stuff\r\n-Keep it short but tricky\r\n\r\n6. When posting a question:\r\n-Look it up first\r\n-Keep it about programming, no Pokemon stuff\r\n-Be clear, give enough information about your problem but not too much like this post\r\n\r\n7.
